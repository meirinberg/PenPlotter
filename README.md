# PenPlotter
ME 405 - Term Project: 2D Pen Plotter. Created by Mike Eirinberg, Ben Bradley, and Ryan Dean.

## Project Background

In ME 405 we were tasked with creating a 2.5 degree of freedom non cartesian pen plotter with the following rules:

1. The project must be able to draw something
2. The device must move in two different degrees of freedom (non Cartesian)
3. Must use stepper motors for 2 axis'
4. Must run off of 24V benchtop power supplies drawing no more than 6A
5. Must be safe (generally no lasers, fire, or hazarderous systems)

## Proposal

We decided to create a polar-based pen plotter that utalizes 2 stepper motors, for our radius and theta axis, and a solenoid to control our pen's vertical movement. This was to be done in a system that had a mount, an arm, and a wheel. The arm would have a lead screw that controls our radius and the wheel controls our theta. An imagine of the system is shown below.
